# 🛒 Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis using Descriptive Statistics

## 📌 Problem Statement
I worked on the **Probability and Statistics Project!** 📊🔍 This project provided an opportunity to apply probability theory and statistical concepts to analyze a real-world dataset. By exploring customer purchase behavior, I extracted meaningful insights to optimize marketing strategies.

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project was to analyze customer information and purchasing behavior to:
- Identify patterns, trends, and correlations.
- Understand customer demographics and their impact on spending habits.
- Segment customers based on their behaviors.
- Optimize marketing efforts and increase offer acceptance rates.

## 📚 About the Dataset
The dataset was gathered during last year's campaign and contained the following key attributes:

- **Response (Target)**: `1` if the customer accepted the offer, `0` otherwise.
- **ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Year_Birth**: Year of birth (used to calculate age).
- **Complain**: `1` if the customer complained in the last 2 years.
- **Dt_Customer**: Date of customer enrollment.
- **Education**: Customer's level of education.
- **Marital**: Marital status.
- **Kidhome**: Number of small children in the household.
- **Teenhome**: Number of teenagers in the household.
- **Income**: Yearly household income.
- **MntFishProducts**: Amount spent on fish products in the last 2 years.
- **MntMeatProducts**: Amount spent on meat products.
- **MntFruits**: Amount spent on fruits.
- **MntSweetProducts**: Amount spent on sweet products.
- **MntWines**: Amount spent on wine.
- **MntGoldProds**: Amount spent on gold products.
- **NumDealsPurchases**: Number of purchases made with a discount.
- **NumCatalogPurchases**: Purchases made via catalog.
- **NumStorePurchases**: Purchases made in physical stores.
- **NumWebPurchases**: Purchases made online.
- **NumWebVisitsMonth**: Visits to the company's website in the last month.
- **Recency**: Number of days since the last purchase.

## 📌 Task 1 - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
I handled missing values appropriately through imputation, removal, or analysis-based adjustments. I ensured consistency in data types for each attribute and summarized statistics such as mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.

**Deliverables:**
- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
- Detailed report on handling missing values and data inconsistencies.
- Summary statistics of numerical variables.

## 📊 Task 2 - Descriptive Statistics
I computed **measures of central tendency** (mean, median, mode) and **measures of dispersion** (variance, standard deviation). I also identified and handled outliers.

**Deliverables:**
- Statistical analysis showcasing customer demographics.
- Insights into variations and potential outliers.

## 🎂 Task 3 - Probability Distributions
I identified key variables that followed probability distributions such as **Binomial, Normal, or Poisson**. I also calculated probabilities and expected values for relevant attributes.

**Deliverables:**
- Analysis of suitable probability distributions.
- Probability calculations and expected value assessments.

## 📈 Task 4 - Customer Segmentation & Insights
I explored relationships between **customer demographics and spending patterns**. I segmented customers based on behaviors (e.g., high spenders, discount buyers, online shoppers) and implemented **Machine Learning-based Clustering** to group customers based on their buying patterns.

**Deliverables:**
- Segmentation of customers into meaningful groups.
- Key findings related to purchasing trends.

## 🏆 Task 5 - Conclusion & Recommendations
I created **visualizations** that highlighted key insights and provided actionable recommendations to improve marketing and sales strategies.

**Deliverables:**
- Well-designed visualizations showcasing customer behaviors.
- Strategic recommendations for the company.
